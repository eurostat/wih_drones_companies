This repository contains the code developed for the project ["Web Intelligence for Measuring Emerging Economic Trends: the Drone Industry"](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/Drones_en), run by Eurostat.

This project aims to develop a generalizable webscraped based approach to detect Drone companie active in a (European) country. Countries used to develope such an approach are Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany. Apart from the script files (1,2,3,4a,4b) and the combines results of script 1 file, the Drone functions file and payed Google search file are needed.
In addition Ini-files for the countries, access to a VPN provider (SurfShark), and a browser emulation script are needed. Also, for each country, files with names of cities and country are required (in both languages scraped)
